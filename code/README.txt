Minimal MPD Client - v24.11.1

Check out the offline help under the Help menu. (updated for v24.11.1)

v24.11.1
  - Changed versioning scheme. I like the year (24.) month (11.) iteration (1) numbering.
  - Incorporated a code change based on a recommendation from donburch888. Thanks Don!
  - Added an option under the Queue menu to save the current queue to a .m3u file 
    in the folder of your choice.  This helped me get my favorites on my phone.
  - I also added the 'requirements.txt' file from my Windows 'venv' to the repo.
